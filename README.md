# Computer Architecture Lab
In this course we have done 11 simple projects.


## 

  # Projects
  
- ### HW1 

in this homework we built four-input OR gate and a simple full adder.

- ### HW2 

in this project we used 2x4 decoder to build a 4x1 multiplayer.

- ### HW3

in this project at first we built a JK type flip-flop, D type flip-flop, and T type flip-flop and finally we used the T type flip-flop to implement a 4 bit up/down counter with. a control bit.

- ### HW4

in this project we built a Mealy/Moore sequence detector for "1110" string.

- ### HW5

in this project we built a 4 bit Ripple adder.

- ### HW6

in this project we built 4bit a full  Ripple adder/subtractor, 4 bit carry save adder, and 4 bit carry lookahead adder.

- ### HW7

in this project we built a simple 4*5 multiplayer, 4*5 array multiplayer, and onother 4*5 multiplayer using carry save addder.

- ### HW8 

in this project we built a 4 bit PISO shift register.

- ### HW9 

in this project we built a ROM and a RAM with 32 blocks, which ea=very blocks contains 8 bits.

- ### HW10

in this project we built a simple ALU contains a 4 bit adder, increamention unit, left shifting unit.

- ### HW11 

in this project we implement a simple basic computer using ROM, RAM, and ALU written in previous HWs.
